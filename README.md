PyBank and PyPoll Homework


## PyBank

![Revenue](Image/BANK.jpg)

* Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* As an example, our analysis should look similar to the one below:


* Financial Analysis
* Total Months: 86
* Total: $22564198
* Average Change: -8311.11
* Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
* Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
  
  
* In addition, our final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

![Voting](Image/POLL.png)

* In this challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

* We will be give a set of poll data called election_data. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* As an example, Our analysis should look similar to the one below:

* Election Results
* Total Votes: 369712
* Charles Casper Stockham: 23.048% (85213)
* Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
* Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
* Winner: Diana DeGette

  
* In addition, our final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Please Note:
* I did explaine my steps in my comments and anywhere I used google to find a better function or way, I mentioned it.
